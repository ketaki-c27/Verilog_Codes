# Verilog_Codes

**Introduction :** 
This repository is a collection of Verilog codes aimed at helping users learn and implement digital design concepts. It includes examples for beginners and complex designs for advanced users.

**Features :**
Basic Verilog programs to understand syntax and concepts.
RTL design examples for combinational and sequential circuits.
Testbenches for functional simulation.
Designs for FPGA implementation.

**Setup:**


Simulator: Any Verilog simulator like ModelSim or Xilinx Vivado.

Editor: Text editor or IDE with Verilog support, e.g., VS Code or Quartus.


Steps to Run
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ketaki-c27/Verilog_Codes.git


Open the desired .v file in your Verilog simulator.


Compile and simulate the file using the simulator's tools.


Review the waveforms or console outputs for verification.
